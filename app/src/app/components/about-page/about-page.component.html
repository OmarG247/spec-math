      What is Spec Math?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Spec Math is a service for performing operations on OpenAPI
      specifications. <a href="https://swagger.io/specification/">OpenAPI</a> is
      an industry-standard format for machine-readable REST API descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Specifications play a critical role in the API lifecycle. They can enforce
      a contract between client and server teams, easily generate documentation
      and client libraries, reduce the work of creating a proxy for an existing
      service and much more. The Spec Math project aims to afford even more
      power to API developers who use the OpenAPI specification.

      How does it work?
    </h2>
    <p>
      We use tree traversal algorithms to represent a YAML file and have the
      ability to compare or edit each of these "nodes".

            One feature of Spec Math is to merge two or more specs into one. The
            developers could then have each team working on their own APIs with
            their own respective specs. From there, the developers can leverage
            the Spec Math Library to create a unified spec to describe the APIs
            developed across all the teams.

            Overlay allows developers to place OpenAPI spec fragments on top of
            existing specs. For example, in the case of both filtering and
            merging, the resultant spec represents a different API product than
            the input specs. This is why overlaying functionality will also be
            supported. An overlay can be applied using a “default file” which
            contains metadata about the final API product that is produced from
            Spec Math operations.

            The developers are now able to unify the specs across multiple teams
            using the union feature of the Spec Math Library. Now, though,
            providers want to give specific user groups and developer teams access
            to portions of the unified API. For example, the developers now want
            to create a public API with all of the API endpoints across all teams
            that do not require internal authentication. It would be a tedious and
            error-prone process to manually cherry-pick pieces of the unified API
            and paste them into a new public API spec. With filtering, the
            developers can provide the unified spec, along with a list of filter
            criteria that they want to match, and get a new spec matching the
            criteria. For example, filtering would allow the developers to
            generate a new spec with only the "public" tagged operations.
