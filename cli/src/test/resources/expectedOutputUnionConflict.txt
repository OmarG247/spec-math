There were conflicts in the union process

Please see the file src/test/resources/fakeFileName.yaml_CONFLICTS for more information

To resolve the conflicts you have three choices:
1: Automatically resolving the conflicts by updating the "resolvedValue" property in src/test/resources/fakeFileName.yaml_CONFLICTS with your desired option, and then passing that file into the union as an additional parameter using the -c flag

2: Manually resolve the conflicts by looking at src/test/resources/fakeFileName.yaml_CONFLICTS and changing the input YAML files

3: Resolve the conflicts by updating/creating a defaults file with overrides for the conflicting keypaths in src/test/resources/fakeFileName.yaml_CONFLICTS, and pass in the new defaults file into the union as an additional parameter using the -d flags
